I was born and raised in a small town, where my fascination with computers began at an early age. My name is Willie, and I am currently a cyber security student. I have always been drawn to the world of technology and its endless possibilities. As I grew older, I became increasingly interested in the field of cyber security and decided to pursue it as a career. During my studies, I became involved in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, which allowed me to apply my knowledge in a practical setting. In 2023, my team, r00t, and I had the honor of winning the Cyber Security Bootcamp and Hackathon Series. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that further fueled my passion for cyber security. In addition to my practical experience, I have also dedicated myself to continuous learning and improvement. I have been awarded several certificates of completion in various platforms such as TryHackMe, demonstrating my commitment to staying updated with the latest developments in the field. My journey in cyber security has been an exciting one, and I am eager to continue growing and contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of digital security.
